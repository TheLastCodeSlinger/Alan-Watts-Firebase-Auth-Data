# Project about a British philosopher known as [Alan Wilson Watts](https://auth-21408.web.app) (1915-1973) 
### His way of thinking and inspiring lectures caught my attention. This site has some information about his life and a collection of some of his best quotes.

#### This project uses Router, StyledComponents, has Authentication and is connected with Firebase Realtime Database.
#### Everything is responsive down to 250px. 

###### First project with styled.components and i gotta say, i like it. It has great visibility and doesn't require extra files for css. Thinks i could imporove on: GlobalStyling. Didn't use it too often, but as the project grows bigger, centralized styling for colours/components(like buttons, inputs) would make the files cleaner (less copy/paste).
###### Router: Privateroute only for authenticated user. Else the basics, but during research i found hints to improve url-fetching i might implement in my other projects.


#### To run this project: 1. npm install 2. npm start.
